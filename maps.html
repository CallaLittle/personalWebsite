The main goal of this assignment was to create a nice relief map. A detailed representation of the area was made in ArcMap and then combined with a generalized version made in <a href ="http://terraincartography.com/terrainsculptor/" target="blank_">Terrain Sculptor</a>. The rest of the rest of the work was done in Photoshop and Illustrator. This map was one of my favorites to create.</p>

Since I am interested in physical geography and earth sciences, I chose something that would fit my interests. The map depicts locations of impact craters in North America. I chose to map North America because it had the most data available. I used graduated symbols to represent the size of the meteor impact and applied a sequential color scheme to represent their age. This map won second place in the Barbara Bartz Petchenik Memorial Award in Cartographic Design.</p>

                            <p class="titleheader">This was my first attempt at creating a custom tileset in mapbox. I chose to mimic the artistic style of Mario Kart 64, which was one of my favorite games when I was growing up. This tileset was a challenge to make. I included many textures and spent a lot of time in photoshop learning how to make them render seemlessly. It was also my first time using CartoCSS, which took a little bit to adjust to. I think one of the most frustrating things was having to apply the same style to every location if it was in the same class. It resulted in the map looking good in some places and poor in others. I look forward to spending more time creating interactive maps.
