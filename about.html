		                 <p>I am an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin - Madison studying Cartography/GIS and Physical Geography. I am expecting to receive my B.S. in May 2016. In addition to studying cartography, I work at the <a href="http://www.geography.wisc.edu/cartography/" target="blank_">UW Cartography Lab</a>, where I get to make maps in a professional setting and gain experience meeting clients' needs. In addition to my work with print mapping I am also interested in interactive web mapping. I have spent a significant amount of time programming, mainly in Java, which has done a great job of teaching me object-oriented programming. I am hoping to apply the theories I have learned in my programming courses to making awesome interactive maps. I have also spent a good chunk of time interpreting satellite imagery and processing images. Remote sensing holds a very close second to cartography when it comes to the work I enjoy doing. I also have experience in GIS. In addition to the classes I have taken and projects I have had to complete for school, I worked for the City of Sun Prairie where I updated databases and wrote Python scripts to automate tasks. I also became real familiar with the Arc Toolbox. I've heard many people say "You're either a cartographer or you're GIS". I fully disagree with that statement. I love doing both; Design work is fun and relaxing (ususally) while I view GIS, programming, and remote sensing as an opportunity to solve a puzzle. Ultimately I would like to work in an environment where I will have the opportunity to apply all the skills I have gained. If you would like to know more about me, check out the links below and feel free to send me an email.
